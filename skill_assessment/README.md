Absolutely, that's a great approach! Here's a Golang cata designed to assess various aspects of your knowledge. You'll be working on a small program that performs the following tasks:

### Golang Cata: Skill Assessment

#### Objective
Create a Golang program that:
1. Defines a `Person` struct with `Name`, `Age`, and `Email` fields.
2. Implements a function `CreatePerson(name string, age int, email string) *Person` that returns a pointer to a new `Person`.
3. Implements a method `GetInfo() string` for the `Person` struct that returns a string in the format: `"Name: [Name], Age: [Age], Email: [Email]"`.
4. Uses Goroutines and Channels to asynchronously create two `Person` objects and fetch their information.
5. Writes the fetched information to a text file named `persons.txt`.

#### Constraints
- Time limit: 20 minutes
- Do not use any third-party libraries

Feel free to start coding! Once you're done, you can post the code here. The clock starts now! ‚è∞üë®‚Äçüíª
